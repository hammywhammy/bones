  * css
  * flexbox

## editor

I am using [atom](https://atom.io/) for all of this work. Please look through it's features.

## html

This stuff is very simple, but for a good bit of info please check out [this course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) to get in to it.

## css

So we are using a [css reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). These are used to normalize all css across browsers.

We are also using [border box](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) for normalizing all of the boxes.

## flexbox

We are using flexbox for layout. To learn a lot more check out [css flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
